# Docker Templates
## Intro
This repo is hosting some docker templates for the `Hacking-La 2.0` platform.

## Why? 
Hacking-Lab 2.0 is a `CTF` and `Cyber Academy` education platform.  In HL 2.0 students can spin up their own and private docker service. But there are many options available, how to setup a docker. For example

* docker with static ctf flag
* docker with dynamic ctf flag
* docker with static usernames and passwords
* docker with dynamic usernames and passwords
* docker instances running per user
* docker instances running as singleton

Thus, this repo shall help challenge and docker service devlopers creating nice and cool `Challenge Dockers` for the `HL 2.0` platform.
